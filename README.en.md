**MarkMello is an application for quickly opening and reading Markdown files, with an additional editing mode.**

## What MarkMello can do

MarkMello allows you to:

- quickly open Markdown files in reading mode;
- adjust the reading experience: theme, font size, line height, and document width;
- switch to editing mode when needed and make changes to the file.

## How it differs from regular Markdown editors

MarkMello opens the file for reading first.

Editing is not the primary startup mode: it is enabled manually when you need to make changes.

## Installation

Download the latest build from [Releases](../../releases/latest).

### Windows

1. Download `MarkMello-setup-win-x64.exe` or `MarkMello-setup-win-arm64.exe`, depending on your computer architecture.
2. Run the installer.
3. Launch MarkMello from the Start menu or open a `.md` file with MarkMello.

### macOS

1. Download `MarkMello-macos-arm64.dmg` for Apple Silicon or `MarkMello-macos-x64.dmg` for Intel Mac.
2. Open the DMG.
3. Drag `MarkMello.app` into `Applications`.
4. Launch the app from `Applications`.

### Linux

If a Linux AppImage is attached to a release, run it like this:

```bash
chmod +x MarkMello-linux-x86_64.AppImage
./MarkMello-linux-x86_64.AppImage
```

If no Linux asset is published for the release you want, build the application from source.

## Temporary unsigned builds

Current public MarkMello builds are temporarily distributed without a developer signature. Because of that, Windows or macOS may show a warning on first launch.

This is a temporary distribution pipeline limitation. Developer signing and the normal notarization/signing chain will be added in the future.

### Windows: bypass SmartScreen

If Windows shows a SmartScreen warning:

1. Click `More info`.
2. Click `Run anyway`.

If Windows marked the downloaded file as blocked:

1. Open the installer file properties.
2. Enable `Unblock`, if the option is available.
3. Apply the changes and run the installer again.

### macOS: bypass Gatekeeper

If macOS says the app is damaged, cannot be verified, or cannot be opened because it is from an unknown developer:

1. Open `System Settings`.
2. Go to `Privacy & Security`.
3. Find the message about blocked `MarkMello`.
4. Click `Open Anyway`.
5. Confirm the launch.

If you need to remove the quarantine flag manually for a one-time test:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/MarkMello.app
open /Applications/MarkMello.app
```

## Build from source

.NET SDK 9 is required.

```bash
dotnet restore ./MarkMello.sln
dotnet build ./MarkMello.sln
```

Run the project:

```bash
dotnet run --project ./src/MarkMello.Desktop/MarkMello.Desktop.csproj
```

Open a file from the command line:

```bash
dotnet run --project ./src/MarkMello.Desktop/MarkMello.Desktop.csproj -- ./sample.md
```
